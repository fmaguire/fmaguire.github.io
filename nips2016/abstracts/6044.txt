A sampling-based optimization method for quadratic functions is   proposed. Our method approximately solves the following   $n$-dimensional quadratic minimization problem in constant time,   which is independent of $n$:   $z^*=\min_{\bv \in \bbR^n}\bracket{\bv}{A \bv} +   n\bracket{\bv}{\diag(\bd)\bv} + n\bracket{\bb}{\bv}$,   where $A \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ is a matrix and $\bd,\bb \in \bbR^n$   are vectors. Our theoretical analysis specifies the number of   samples $k(\delta, \epsilon)$ such that the approximated solution   $z$ satisfies $|z - z^*| = O(\epsilon n^2)$ with probability   $1-\delta$. The empirical performance (accuracy and runtime) is   positively confirmed by numerical experiments.
