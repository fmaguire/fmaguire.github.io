We study the effectiveness of neural sequence models for premise selection in automated theorem proving, a key bottleneck for progress in formalized mathematics. We propose a two stage approach for this task that yields good results for the premise selection task on the Mizar corpus while avoiding the hand-engineered features of existing state-of-the-art models. To our knowledge, this is the first time deep learning has been applied  theorem proving on a large scale.
