#What?

----

![National Data Science Bowl](assets/presentations/NDSB/NDSB.png)

- 90 days (December 15th 2014 - March 16th 2015) 
- Sponsored by Booz Allen Hamilton
- Kaggle platform
- Data from Oregon State University

----

![In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System](assets/presentations/NDSB/isiis.jpg)
- 5 million shadowgraph images (4-5TB) a day 
- Automatically segmented
- Manual analysis of all infeasible 

----

- Automated identification of plankton
- 121 expert provided labels 
- Goal: generate probability distribution for each image
- 1,293 participants 
- 1,049 teams 
- 15,120 submissions

----

## Scoring
- logloss (cross-entropy loss or negative loglikelihood)
- Sensitive to overconfidence
- Differentiable
- Not the same as accuracy
- 30:70 public:private test data split


#Why?

----

- Important problem
- 
- More useful than an advertising problem

----

## Other reasons

- Good practice
- Fun
 ...$100,000 1st Place Prize

#What was the input?

----

![](assets/presentation/NDSB/raw_data.png)

- 30,336 labelled
- 20,000 unlabelled
- 121 classes

----

## Class Labels

![Hierarchy of labels](assets/presentations/NDSB/hierarchy.png)

----

## Difficulties

----

Error in the ground-truth

- 84-95% self-consistency in labelling \[Culverhouse, 2003\] (Dinoflagellates)
----

PLOT OF CARDINALITIES
Many classes

----

PLOT OF IMAGE SIZES
Unbalacned image sizes

----

# Our approach

----

Combining:
- Convoluted Neural Networks
- Classical Computer Vision

----

##Convnets

- Neural network to deepnet to convnet

----

##Classical Computer Vision

- Visual feature extraction
PLOT OF EXAMPLES

# Getting more data!

![Affine transformations](assets/presentation/NDSB/augmentation.png)
----

## How to take down a server

- Offline augmentation uses a LOT of memory
- More than we had as it turns out
- Our code doesn't fail politely
- Not being nice: misconfigured priorities on cluster


# Our Model


# Combining Convnet and CV

---- 

Doesn't work

# Hierarchial modelling 

----

![Label schema](assets/presentations/NDSB/hierarchy.png)

----

![Left: Original Hiearchy, Right: New Layers](assets/presentations/NDSB/trees.png)

----

- Supplied to six parallel softmax output layers
- Improved initial learning rate but not performance

# Biggest challenges

- Dataset handling
- 


# Conclusions

 


# Eat your time
