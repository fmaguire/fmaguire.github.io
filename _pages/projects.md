- [Neuroglycerin](http://neuroglycerin.org/): co-founder of Machine Learning Competition Team

- [Hail-Seizure](https://github.com/Neuroglycerin/hail-seizure): Seizure prediction from iEEG as part of the American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge mainly using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

- [Neukrill-Net](https://github.com/Neuroglycerin/neukrill-net-work): Convnet classification for identifying plankton as part of the National Data Science Bowl using the [pylearn2](https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn2) deep learning library.

- [BayeHem](https://github.com/fmaguire/BayeHem): Gaussian process based Bayesian Optimisation of NGS Assembly  using GPy and python.

- [hansard-miner](https://github.com/fmaguire/hansard_mining): NLP analysis of the UK parliament Hansard

- [predict-secretome](https://github.com/fmaguire/predict_secretome): Tool to predict whether a given protein will be secreted or not created as part of my PhD research. This project is a python runner script wrapped around fortran and C utilities. 

- [Dendrogenous](https://github.com/fmaguire/dendrogenous): A parallelised batch phylogenetic tree generator tool in python and SQL created as part of my PhD.

- [EcumenicalForest](https:://github.com/fmaguire/dendrogenous): An implementation of Tom Rainforth's [Canonical Correlation Forest Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05444) as a scikit-learn compatible module.

- [DueyDrop](https://github.com/fmaguire/DueyDrop): A tool to conduct taxonomic profiling of NGS sequencing libraries for screening purposes.

- [eDicer](https://github.com/fmaguire/eDicer): A C++ and bash based tool for rapidly finding and identifying shared K-length between different genomes/transcriptomes. This project involved contributions to the [K-mer Analysis Toolkit](https://github.com/TGAC/KAT)

- [ETE Python3 Port](https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete): Ported this python toolkit for analysis of tree structures to python3.  All changes were merged back into the main project and formed a significant proportion of the current major release.

- [Î¼-Colander](https://github.com/fmaguire/mu-colander): An opencv and C++ based tool for analysis microscopy images and automatically extracting images of cells.

- [ParKour](https://github.com/fmaguire/parKour): A K-means clustering tool for partitioning meta-omic sequencing data based on compositional features. This tool is implemented in C++ using Armadillo and MLPACK. 

- [markdown-pprint](https://github.com/fmaguire/markdown-pprint): a tool written with [gngdb](http://gngdb.github.io) for pretty printing equations in markdown when MathJax isn't supported
