Hello, my name is Finlay Maguire.

I'm a recent PhD graduate from University College London in Bioinformatics.

I am primarily interested in finding ways to make use of complex and messy datasets.
For example, my PhD principally focussed on determining the best ways to analyse
cutting edge single cell transcriptomic datasets from multi-eukaryotic systems.

While I am primarily informatics and machine learning orientated these days my undergraduate 
studies at the University of Oxford 
were in Molecular Biology and I have an interest in projects involving this domain.

My full CV is available [here](https://github.com/fmaguire/CV/raw/master/Finlay_Maguire_CV.pdf).
