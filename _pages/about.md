Hello, my name is Finlay Maguire.

![Postgrad Research: Not even once](../images/wedding.jpg)

I'm a senior postdoctoral researcher in Computer Science at Dalhousie University.
I hold an independent interdisciplinary fellowship, so I am lucky to be able to set my own research agenda.
My work is focused around the analysis of large, complex, messy data-sets using a range of statistical, exploratory, and machine-learning computational skills.
The majority of this revolves around microbial bioinformatics (cross-over between microbiology and computer science).
Specifically, I use statistical and machine-learning methods to try to better predict and understand the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.
This involves an on-going collaboration with the Public Health Agency of Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, as well as the [Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database](https://card.mcmaster.ca).

I've recently taken the skills I've developed in this area, namely the analysis of large messy data-sets and begun to apply these more widely.
This is mainly in the form of epidemiological, public health, and socially-focused research collaborations across the university and with various non-profits and charities around Halifax.
This inclues work social media use in autism, prison justice, medical education, refugee healthcare, homelessness, supervised consumption sites, and a SSHRC grant looking at internet usage in the "incel" community (see [projects](http://finlaymagui.re/projects) for a partial list).

Before this my [doctoral research](http://finlaymagui.re/assets/finlay_maguire_final_PhD_2015_thesis.pdf) worked on finding optimal strategies for analysing large, complex, messy biological datasets from a variety of omic resources. 
This included the first ever analysis of *de novo* single cell transcriptomic datasets from multi-eukaryotic systems.  In the course of this work 
I developed several novel computational tools and methods for large scale biological data.
