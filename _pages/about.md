Hello, my name is Finlay Maguire.

![](../images/headshot.jpg)

I'm a jointly appointed Assistant Professor in [Community Health & Epidemiology](https://medicine.dal.ca/departments/department-sites/community-health.html) and [Computer Science](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience.html) at Dalhousie University. Pathogenomics Bioinformatics Lead at Toronto's [Shared Hospital Laboratory](https://www.shn.ca/marking-a-milestone-shared-hospital-laboratory-conducts-one-millionth-covid-19-test/) and Steering Committee & Working Group Co-Chair for [PHA4GE](https://pha4ge.org/).

My research primarily focuses on the genomic epidemiology of infectious diseases. Specifically, developing and applying novel microbial bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to better understand the diagnosis, evolution, and dynamics of infectious diseases. We largely work on problems related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and zoonotic viruses such as Avian Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and apply our work in both clinical and international public health settings. I also work on a number of collaborative clinical epidemiology and data science projects (e.g., characterising online radicalisation).

*The majority of my research updates will posted on my [lab website](https://maguire-lab.github.io/) instead of this website.*

Prior to this my [doctoral research](http://finlaymagui.re/assets/finlay_maguire_final_PhD_2015_thesis.pdf) focused on finding optimal strategies for analysing large, complex, messy biological datasets to understand the evolution of endosymbioses. This included the first analysis of *de novo* single cell transcriptomic datasets from multi-eukaryotic microbial systems.  

A one page version of my CV can be be found [here](http://finlaymagui.re/assets/finlay_maguire_CV_1_page.pdf).
