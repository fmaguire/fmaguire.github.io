Hello, my name is Finlay Maguire.

![Postgrad Research: Not even once](../images/wedding.jpg)

I'm a recent PhD graduate in Bioinformatics with a diverse set of interests
including machine learning, {gen,transcript,metabol}omics, linux and software
development (primarily python and C++).  I really enjoy solving interesting
problems regardless of the field!


My [PhD](https://github.com/fmaguire/PhD_thesis) focussed on finding ways to 
identify optimal strategies for analysing
large, complex, messy biological datasets from a variety of omic resources.
This included the first ever analysis of *de novo* single cell transcriptomic 
datasets from multi-eukaryotic systems.  In the course of this work 
I developed several novel computational tools and methods for large scale biological data
(see [projects](http://finlaymagui.re/projects) for a partial list).


Additionally, I spend a good chunk of my spare time doing Machine Learning competition
with [Gavin Gray](https://gngdb.github.io) and [Scott Lowe](http://scottclowe.com) 
as part of [Neuroglycerin](https://github.com/Neuroglycerin), messing around with linux,
and reading.


My full CV is available [here](https://github.com/fmaguire/CV/raw/master/Finlay_Maguire_CV.pdf)
and a one-page version [here](https://github.com/fmaguire/CV/raw/refactor/Finlay_Maguire_CV.pdf).
