excerpt: Some audiobook/podcast recommendations for Jack

# Podcasts

## National Public Radio (NPR) 

- ``This American Life''  random real stories / journalism about massive range of things.

- ``Radiolab'' about various scientific events with nice/sometimes a bit experimental production.

- ``99% Invisible'' - about how design/architectural choices underlies various things we don't notice around us.

- ``CarTalk''  2 wise-cracking brothers talking about cars with people phoning in with their car problems - sounds shit but is surprisingly entertaining and easy listening.

- Other people have also recommended ``Freakonomics'', ``Hardcore Histories'' and ``My Dad Wrote a Porno''.

## BBC

- ``Infinite Monkey Cage'' is great too if you haven't finished everything on BBC (comedic panel show about a scientific topic).


# Audiobooks

## Fiction

- ``Dresden Files'' by Jim Butcher - first one is "Storm Front" - amusing wisecracking urban fantasty wizard/detective. They get a lot better as the series goes on too (in my opinion)

- ``The Martian'' by Andy Weir was a really good audiobook too (better than the film).

- I'm also a fan of the Ian Rankin's ``Detective Rebus'' audiobooks.

- Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

- Iain M. Banks' ``Culture'' series.

- ``Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrel'' by Susanna Clarke audiobook.

## Non-fiction

- ``Emperor of All Maladies'' by Siddhartha Mukherjee is a super interesting summary of the history and treatment of cancer.

- ``The Dead Hand'' by David Hoffman - looks at cold-war weapons of mass destruction and their regulation/control etc, kinda terrifying.

- ``Under the Banner of Heaven'' by John Krakauer - really good history of the mormon church interspersed with stories about fundamentalist off-shoots.

- ``Tom's River'' by Dan Fagin - about the pollution of a river by a chemical plant, it's impact on the town, cover-ups, investigation of it etc.

- ``Flash Boys'' by Michael Lewis - about high frequency trading (with varying biases but still interesting)

- ``Confessions of an Economic Hitman'' by John Perkins - account of a US based economic adviser and the way he was made to manipulate the economies of developing countries.
