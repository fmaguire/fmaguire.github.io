EarthTV has some high quality cameras around the world. At the moment, they
capture short live clips and store them on a server for viewing minutes later.
Hopefully soon they'll be able to stream live feeds. Nevertheless, I have a
script flip through their locations every 5 minutes to hopefully keep it on a
sunny part of the world (when the "Latest" channel is available) at all times.
EarthTV,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.earthcamtv.com/index.php">EarthCamTV.com</a>, and 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.citycams.tv/en/">CityCams.tv</a>
help me during those nights I want to stay awake.
